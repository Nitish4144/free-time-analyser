## Initial ideation
<b> This project is designed to understand your personal app usage patterns and create a smart, predictive schedule of your digital day.</b>

Think of it as a personal assistant that learns your habits. By looking at when you've used different apps in the past, it builds a daily forecast, hour by hour.<br>
For each one-hour slot, the schedule will show you two things:
* The app you're most likely to open. 
* How long you'll probably use it.

## Possible Features

To make the schedule easy to read at a glance, it uses a simple color-code to highlight your patterns:<br>
* Quick Glances: Any app you're likely to use for less than 10 minutes is shown in a subtle gray font, representing casual use.
* Deep Dives: Any app predicted to hold your attention for more than 50 minutes is highlighted with a bold color, showing you when you're in a state of deep focus (or distraction!)."
